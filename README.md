# network-stack
A trivial network stack from link layer to transport layer

## Background
This is a class project aimed at building a TCP/IP network stack from link layer to transport layer. The implements here are rather trivial and shoule be used for reference or criticize. For your own good, please do not directly copy the code for homework or exams. 

## Using and Testing
You can refer to the files given in the first folder for testing. The implements are tested on virtual networks rather than real ones, and we strongly recommend **not** use it on real networks because it may cause unexpected or even disasterous results. Some checkpoints and handy tool are also given in `src/` for easier testing.

## Platform
These codes are built and tested on Ubuntu20.04.Ubuntu18.04 is also tested and it worked well. For windows, there may be problems using C++ threads or processes, so if you'd like to work on it, get an ubuntu or something like that!
